<img alt="NGINX" src="https://linuxctl.com/images/thumb/cover-nginx.png"/>

The web server has a crucial role in web-based applications. Since most of us leave it to the default configuration, it can leak sensitive data regarding the web server.

By applying numerous configuration tweaks, we can make NGINX more resilient against malicious attacks. Following are some NGINX hardening tips that you can incorporate to improve security.

<a id="1Hide-NGINX-Version" name="1Hide-NGINX-Version"></a>

<strong>1. Hide NGINX Version</strong>

Hiding the NGINX version number can prevent attackers from using known vulnerabilities specific to your NGINX version. Exposing the Nginx version can provide attackers with useful information for targeting known vulnerabilities. To hide the version:

Edit the NGINX configuration file:

- RHEL Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Debian Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/faveo.conf
```

Find the `http` block and add the following line:
```
server_tokens off;
```

Save and exit the file.
```
ctrl + x
```

Restart NGINX:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

The `server_tokens off;` directive disables the display of the NGINX version in HTTP headers and error pages.


<a id="2Disable-Unnecessary-HTTP-Methods" name="2Disable-Unnecessary-HTTP-Methods"></a>

<strong>2. Disable Unnecessary HTTP Methods</strong>

Limiting HTTP methods helps to prevent attacks that exploit certain HTTP methods.

Edit the NGINX configuration file:

- RHEL Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Debian Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/faveo.conf
```

Find the `http` block and add the following line:
```
if ($request_method !~ ^(GET|POST|HEAD)$ ) {
    return 444;
}
```

Save and exit the file.
```
ctrl + x
```

Restart NGINX:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

This configuration will return a `444 No Response` status code for requests using HTTP methods other than GET, POST, and HEAD, which helps mitigate risks..


<a id="3Disable-Directory-Listing" name="3Disable-Directory-Listing"></a>

<strong>3. Disable Directory Listing</strong>

Directory listing should be disabled to prevent exposure of sensitive files and directory contents.

Edit the NGINX configuration file:

- RHEL Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Debian Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/faveo.conf
```

Find the `http` block and add the following line:
```
location / {
    autoindex off;
}
```
For Faveo Helpdesk, we can skip this step as we have already enabled it in default configuration file as below:
```
location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
        }
```

Save and exit the file.
```
ctrl + x
```

Restart NGINX:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

The `autoindex off;` directive disables directory listing.


<a id="4Clickjacking-Defense-with-X-Frame-Options" name="4Clickjacking-Defense-with-X-Frame-Options"></a>

<strong>4. Clickjacking Defense with X-Frame-Options</strong>

To prevent your content from being used in a frame, which could be exploited for clickjacking attacks:

Edit the NGINX configuration file:

- RHEL Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Debian Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/faveo.conf
```

Find the `http` block and add the following line:
```
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
```

Save and exit the file.
```
ctrl + x
```

Restart NGINX:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

The `add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";` directive ensures that your content can only be framed by pages from the same origin.


<a id="5Basic-XSS-Protection" name="5Basic-XSS-Protection"></a>

<strong>5. Basic XSS Protection</strong>

Enabling XSS protection in modern browsers helps prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

Edit the NGINX configuration file:

- RHEL Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Debian Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/faveo.conf
```

Find the `http` block and add the following line:
```
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
```

Save and exit the file.
```
ctrl + x
```

Restart NGINX:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

The `add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";` directive enables the XSS filter built into modern browsers.

<a id="6Enable-HttpOnly-and-Secure-Flags-for-Cookies" name="6Enable-HttpOnly-and-Secure-Flags-for-Cookies"></a>

<strong>6. Enable HttpOnly and Secure Flags for Cookies</strong>

Setting HttpOnly and Secure flags for cookies helps protect them from theft via client-side scripts and ensures they are only sent over HTTPS.

Edit the NGINX configuration file:

- RHEL Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Debian Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/faveo.conf
```

Find the `http` block and add the following line:
```
http {
    ...
    add_header Set-Cookie "HttpOnly;Secure";
    ...
}
```

Save and exit the file.
```
ctrl + x
```

Restart NGINX:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

The `add_header Set-Cookie "HttpOnly;Secure";` directive ensures that cookies are marked as HttpOnly and Secure.


<a id="7Disable-ETag" name="7Disable-ETag"></a>

<strong>7. Disable ETag</strong>

Disabling ETags helps prevent leaking information about the server. Disabling them can enhance privacy.

Edit the NGINX configuration file:

- RHEL Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Debian Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/faveo.conf
```

Find the `http` block and add the following line:
```
server {
    ...
    add_header ETag "";
    ...
}
```

Save and exit the file.
```
ctrl + x
```

Restart NGINX:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

The `add_header ETag "";` directive disables the generation of ETag headers.

<a id="8Enable-HTTP/2-Protocol" name="8Enable-HTTP/2-Protocol"></a>

<strong>8. Enable HTTP/2 Protocol</strong>

Enabling HTTP/2 can improve performance and security over HTTP/1.1..

Edit the NGINX configuration file:

- RHEL Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Debian Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/faveo.conf
```

Find the `http` block and add the following line:
```
listen 443 ssl http2;
```

Save and exit the file.
```
ctrl + x
```

Restart NGINX:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

The `listen 443 ssl http2;` directive enables HTTP/2 for improved performance.


<a id="9Set-Referrer-Policy" name="9Set-Referrer-Policy"></a>

<strong>9. Set Referrer Policy</strong>

A referrer policy can prevent sensitive information from being leaked in HTTP referrer headers. Setting a strict referrer policy enhances privacy and security.

Edit the NGINX configuration file:

- RHEL Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Debian Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/faveo.conf
```

Find the `http` block and add the following line:
```
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin";
```

Save and exit the file.
```
ctrl + x
```

Restart NGINX:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

The `add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin";` directive sets a referrer policy that restricts referrer information sent with requests.


<a id="10Set-Permissions-Policy" name="10Set-Permissions-Policy"></a>

<strong>10. Set Permissions Policy</strong>

Implementing a permissions policy can enhance the security of your site by controlling the use of certain features. Permissions policies (formerly known as Feature Policy) control which features and APIs can be used in your web application.

Edit the NGINX configuration file:

- RHEL Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Debian Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/faveo.conf
```

Find the `http` block and add the following line:
```
add_header Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()";
```

Save and exit the file.
```
ctrl + x
```

Restart NGINX:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

The `add_header Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()";` directive restricts access to certain features.

<a id="11Enforce-HSTS-HTTP-Strict-Transport-Security" name="11Enforce-HSTS-HTTP-Strict-Transport-Security"></a>

<strong>11. Enforce HSTS-HTTP Strict Transport Security</strong>

Enforcing HSTS ensures that browsers only connect to your server over HTTPS.

Edit the NGINX configuration file:

- RHEL Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

- Debian Based Servers
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/faveo.conf
```

Find the `http` block and add the following line:
```
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";
```

Save and exit the file.
```
ctrl + x
```

Restart NGINX:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

The `add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";` directive enforces HSTS for one year and includes all subdomains.

## Nginx Virtual Host Configuration for Security Hardening
