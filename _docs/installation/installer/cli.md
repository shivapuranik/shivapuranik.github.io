title: "Faveo CLI Installer"
---

Faveo comes with a CLI installer to help and guide you through the installation process. While the installer provides step by step guide during the installation, it's important and helpful to have general knowledge about Web servers, PHP and MySQL.

Before getting started make sure your server meets following [minimum requirement](/docs/system-requirement/requirement/) required to install and use Faveo

<a id="getting-started" name="getting-started"></a>
## Getting Started

Download the latest version of Faveo from [https://billing.faveohelpdesk.com](https://billing.faveohelpdesk.com) and upload the .zip files in the folder/directory on your server.

Faveo Community version can also be downloaded directly from [Github](https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk)

Basic knowledge of using FTP is an added advantage at this stage. If you don't know how to use FTP, we would recommend you read the documentation supplied with your FTP client and learn the basics of uploading and setting permissions on files. 

Type the command below to start the Faveo CLI installer

```sh
php artisan install:faveo
```

### Step 1: Server Requirements

The installer will perform the system requirement test and if it spots any errors it will report. When all your server checklists are configured correctly it displays as “Loading”. You can Continue to next installation step once all the server requirment are meet.
