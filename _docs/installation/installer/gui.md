title: "Faveo Web GUI Installer"
---

Faveo comes with a web-based installer to help and guide you through the installation process. While the installer provides step by step guide during the installation, it's important and helpful to have general knowledge about Web servers, PHP and MySQL.

Before getting started make sure your server meets following [minimum requirement](/docs/system-requirement/requirement/) required to install and use Faveo

<a id="getting-started" name="getting-started"></a>
## Getting Started

Download the latest version of Faveo from [https://billing.faveohelpdesk.com](https://billing.faveohelpdesk.com) and upload the .zip files in the folder/directory on your server.

Faveo Community version can also be downloaded directly from [Github](https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-helpdesk)

Basic knowledge of using FTP is an added advantage at this stage. If you don't know how to use FTP, we would recommend you read the documentation supplied with your FTP client and learn the basics of uploading and setting permissions on files. 

You can get the installer by simply browsing the Faveo URL (Faveo Hosted URL). Faveo installation script will attempt to auto-detect paths and any permission issues. By following the given instructions, you can complete the installation and basic setup in a web browser. If the installation spots any configuration errors then it will not allow you to continue until the errors are corrected.

### Step 1: Server Requirements

The installer will perform the system requirement test and if it spots any errors then it will not allow you to continue until all the requirements are met. When all your server checklists are configured correctly it displays as “Enabled” and you click on the Continue button to move on with the installation process.
