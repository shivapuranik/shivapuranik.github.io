title: "Faveo Installation on CentOS Web Panel"
---

This document will list on how to install Faveo Helpdesk on a new Centos Web Panel on Centos server.

**Note:** Need Centos 7 fresh server to Install Centos Web Panel(CWP).  

## 1.Setup Hostname

To start the CWP installation, login into your server as root and make sure to set the correct hostname.

Important: The hostname and domain name must be different on your server (for example, if domain.com is your domain on your server, then use hostname.domain.com as your fully qualified hostname).

```sh
hostnamectl set-hostname hostname.domain.com
```

## 2. Installing CentOS Web Panel

```sh
yum -y update
yum -y install wget
cd /usr/local/src
wget https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-server-images/blob/master/installation-scripts/helpdesk/cwp.sh
chmod +x cwp.sh
./cwp.sh
```

Please be patient as the installation progress can take between 10 and 20 minutes to complete. Once the install has finished you should see a screen saying “CWP” installed and list of credentials required to access the panel. Make sure to copy or write down the information and keep it safe:

Once ready, press “ENTER” for server reboot. If the system does not reboot automatically simply type “reboot” to reboot the server.
 
```sh
reboot
```
 
After server reboot, login into server as root, once login you will see different welcome screen with information about the logged users and the current disk space usage.

Now log in to your CentOS Web Panel server using the link provided by the installer on your server.

- **CentOS Web Panel Admin GUI:** https://SERVER-IP:2031/
- **Username:** root
- **Password:** your-os-root-password

## 3. Point domain to CentOS Web Panel server
As the Centos Web panel is now installed. You can host Faveo in this Centos Web Panel.

**Note:** You should have Domain pointing to this server.

## 4. Create user account  on CentOS Web Panel
Create user account under User Accounts > New account. 
 For creating a user account it is mandatory that you have a FQDN pointing to your server Public IP at this point.

 Note: If your server sits behind a NAT network you have to enable the NAT-ed option in CWP settings. Usually if you setup your server on AWS or GCP they come with NAT network, so you have to enable NAT-ed in CWP settings. 
 
 Goto > CWP Settings > Edit Settings select proper Public IP and Private IP  Scroll down and click on activate NAT-ed network configuration and don't forget to Rebuild the Web server once this is enabled.

## 5. Change PHP version and install PHP extension

CWP by default PHP 5.6 will be installed. You can install different PHP versions and their extensions in the panel.

Faveo needs PHP 7.3,and some extensions.

PHP Settings > php version switcher > Select the desired PHP version i.e, 7.3.22 and enable the following plugins imap, ldap, ioncube, fpm, redis and click on save & build. This will take approximately 20 minutes once it is done you will recieve a notification on successfull build with a hyper link to apply the configuration click on it to configure the new PHP version and you confirm to the new version in the Home dashboard displaying the current PHP version.

## 7. Upload Faveo
Please download Faveo Helpdesk from [https://billing.faveohelpdesk.com](https://billing.faveohelpdesk.com) and upload it to the server

Click on File Management > File manager and upload Faveo files

At this point you need to make some changes to public/.htaccess file inside the Faveo root directory. This is done beacuse CWP limits some HTTP Headers in its global configuration in order to bypass the global settings this step is necessary.

Just open the public/.htaccess to edit and append the below code in it and save the file. This can be done from the CWP Admin panel itself.

```sh
<Limit GET POST PUT OPTIONS DELETE PATCH HEAD>
    Require all granted
</Limit>
```

### 13. Redis Installation

Redis is an open-source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.

This is an optional step and will improve system performance and is highly recommended.
